# Predicting Customer Churn using Telco Data and Estimating Hypothetical Business Impact

In this project I use [telco churn data](https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn) available on Kaggle to build a churn prediction model and estimate the hypothetical business impact such a model could have. For more details please check out the notebook or the Kaggle kernel [here](https://www.kaggle.com/alexvmt/predicting-churn-estimating-business-impact).
